## Introduction

The tenth project of 42's curriculum asks students to configure small-scale networks. To do that, it's necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works.

To sum up, the most important concepts required for this project are:

- What a router, a switch and host are and how they work;
- WAN vs. LAN;
- What protocols are and how TCP/IP works;
- Public and private IP addresses;
- Static routing;
- Submask and CIDR Notation;
- What a interface, its destination and its next-hop are.

## How to use the repository

There are two folders: `net_practice` and `solutions`. The first directory contains the exercises to be done and the second folder have the answers for each one of the 10 levels.
